# System Utilities Library

A comprehensive Python toolkit for system operations, featuring modules for:

* ‚úÖ Terminal screen management
* ‚úÖ System command and Bash script execution
* ‚úÖ Data synchronization using `rsync`
* ‚úÖ Disk geometry-based storage calculations
* ‚úÖ Log file analysis and export

## üì¶ Introduction

The **System Utilities Library** is a modular and extensible collection of utilities aimed at easing common system-level operations. Whether you're automating server tasks, building DevOps scripts, or creating admin tools, this library provides a robust, cross-platform foundation with clean exception handling and support for parallel operations.

## üöÄ Features

* Clear and portable screen clearing
* Robust system command runner with timeout and error capturing
* Bash script execution with optional input and arguments
* Reliable data sync using `rsync` with multiprocessing support
* Interactive disk storage calculator based on drive geometry
* Log file analyzer supporting filtering and exporting

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

To run the full demo from the command line:

```bash
python3 system_utils.py
```

### Example: Clear Screen

```python
from system_utils import ScreenManager
ScreenManager().clear_screen()
```

### Example: Run Bash Script

```python
runner = BashScriptRunner('path/to/script.sh')
stdout, stderr, code = runner.run_script(input_data="input", args=["arg1", "arg2"])
```

### Example: Sync Directories

```python
sync = DataSyncManager('/source/dir', '/destination/dir')
sync.sync_data(parallel=True)
```

### Example: Calculate Disk Storage

```python
calc = DiskStorageCalculator(['Cylinders', 'Heads', 'Sectors', 'Bytes per Sector'])
calc.preview_storage()
```

### Example: Analyze Logs

```python
analyzer = LogAnalyzer('system.log')
entries = analyzer.search_logs('ERROR', 'timeout')
analyzer.export_logs(entries, 'errors.log')
```
