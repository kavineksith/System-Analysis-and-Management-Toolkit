![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

A comprehensive system monitoring and reporting tool that collects detailed system information and presents it in an organized, JSON format for analysis and troubleshooting.

## Features

- üñ•Ô∏è **Comprehensive System Monitoring**:
  - CPU statistics (usage, cores, frequencies)
  - Memory usage (virtual and swap)
  - Disk information (partitions, usage, I/O)
  - Network status (interfaces, connections, traffic)
  - Process details (running processes, resource usage)
  - Battery information (where applicable)
  - System information (OS, users, uptime)

- üõ†Ô∏è **Advanced Functionality**:
  - Modular architecture for easy extension
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Configurable logging (file and console)
  - JSON output for easy parsing
  - Interactive CLI interface
  - File export capabilities
  - Cross-platform compatibility

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip package manager

### Required Packages
```bash
pip install psutil netifaces
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface
Run the tool interactively:
```bash
python system_analyzer.py
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from system_analyzer import SystemAnalyzerApp

app = SystemAnalyzerApp()
app.run()
```

### Report Options
The interactive menu provides these options:
1. CPU Information
2. Process Information
3. Memory Information
4. Disk Information
5. Network Information
6. System Information
7. Battery Information
8. All-in-one report
9. Exit

## Output Format

All reports are generated in JSON format. Example structure:

```json
{
  "cpu_usage": {
    "total": 15.7,
    "per_core": [12.5, 18.9, 10.2, 21.3]
  },
  "logical_cores": 8,
  "physical_cores": 4,
  "cpu_times": {
    "user": 12345.67,
    "system": 2345.67,
    "idle": 34567.89
  },
  "timestamp": "15:30:45 | 15/06/2023"
}
```

    "percent": 25.0
  },
  "timestamp": "14:25:15 | 15/06/2023"
}
```

## Configuration

### Logging
By default, logs are written to `system_analysis.log`. You can configure logging by modifying the `LogManager` class.

### Output Directory
Reports are saved to the current directory by default, but you can specify any output directory during report generation.

## Error Handling

The tool provides comprehensive error handling with:
- Clear error messages
- Graceful degradation
- Detailed logging
- Recovery mechanisms
